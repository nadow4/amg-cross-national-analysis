Antimicrobial Resistance Gene (ARG) Cross-National Analysis
This repository contains the fully annotated R Markdown workflow and rendered HTML output used for the statistical analyses presented in:
Dowling, N. A. (2026). House Sparrows as Sentinels of Antimicrobial Resistance: A Cross-National Investigation. University of South Florida.
Overview
The analysis evaluates antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) prevalence and diversity in house sparrows sampled across eight countries. Models test a priori hypotheses examining the influence of:
Socioeconomic context (GDP)
Antimicrobial stewardship strength
Human antibiotic consumption
Livestock antibiotic use
Local exposure metrics (farm proximity, wastewater treatment plants)
Model comparison was conducted using AICc among pre-specified candidate models. Diagnostic checks for collinearity, overdispersion, and residual structure are included.
Reproducibility
All analyses were conducted in R (version X.X.X).
Required packages and session information are provided within the R Markdown file.
The HTML document provides a fully rendered, transparent record of all analytical steps.
